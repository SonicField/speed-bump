## Session: NBS Discovery & Recovery

### Context
- Project cloned from GitHub to `~/local/speed-bump`
- Goal: Get NBS-compliant before AI training work next week

### Discovery Phase

**Terminal goal confirmed**: Identify performance-critical Python code in GPU-accelerated async systems by artificial slowdown, not traditional profiling.

**Artefacts found**: Clean codebase, no dead ends. All files kept.

**Key insight from human**: "Time spent ≠ time that matters" - traditional profilers miss async/GPU interactions.

### Verification (Worker-001)

**Build**: C extension compiled with direct gcc (pip unavailable).
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC $PYTHON_INCLUDES -O3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -D_GNU_SOURCE \
    src/speed_bump/_core.c -o src/speed_bump/_core$EXT_SUFFIX
```

**Tests**: 28/28 pass (manual test runner, pytest unavailable).

**Clock overhead**: 25 ns (minimum delay: 50 ns).

### Recovery Phase

**Steps executed**:
1. Created plan file (`01-02-2026-speed-bump-plan.md`)
2. Created this progress log
3. (pending) Document limitations in README
4. (pending) Annotate Statistics TODO with uncertainty
5. (pending) Add manual build instructions
6. (pending) Git commit
7. (pending) Verify final state

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep all artefacts | No dead ends found |
| Document limitations explicitly | Known issues were only in human's memory |
| Keep Statistics TODO with uncertainty note | Don't pretend to know what it means; schedule investigation |

### Open Items for Next Session

- `/nbs-investigation` on Statistics collection
- Test with free-threaded Python if available
